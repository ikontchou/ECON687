## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#problem 2: Learning about Git

#Git is an open source software for version control. In #simple terms, using git helps see all the previous versions #of codes created. For example, making commits, it's #equivalent to saving copies of a version of codes.Committing #a file/files creates metadata such as changes made to the #files: what, who, when changes were made.Another significant #part of git is the ability to do experiments through #branches. Also, using a remote, git can facilitate #collaborative work by allowing different people to #simultaneously work on the same project.
